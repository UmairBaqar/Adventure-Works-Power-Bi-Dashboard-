<h3>**📊 Adventure Works Sales Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)**</h3>

A comprehensive sales performance dashboard built to uncover product, customer, and regional insights using the Adventure Works demo dataset.


**🔍 Project Overview**
This project analyzes sales performance for Adventure Works, a global manufacturing company. The goal was to create a decision-support dashboard that helps sales leaders understand revenue trends, customer behavior, product performance, and regional opportunities.
The dashboard is designed using Power BI, following best practices in data modeling, DAX, and business analysis to ensure clarity, scalability, and actionable insights.



**🎯 Business Problem**
